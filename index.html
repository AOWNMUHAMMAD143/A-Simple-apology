        hey... 😔<br><br>
        i didn’t text you all day—not because of ego, but because i was hoping you’d message me once things calmed down.<br><br>
        but waiting in silence… felt like being ignored, and honestly, that hurt more than i expected. still, here i am again—saying 
        <em>sorry</em> 💔<br><br>
        if i made you feel unimportant, that was never my intention.<br><br>
        maybe what hurts most… is realizing i might not mean to you what you still mean to me 😞<br><br>
        <strong>still, i care. still, i’m here.</strong> 💬💖<br><br>
        with all the words i couldn’t say out loud,<br>
        <strong>– the one who still chooses you, silently.</strong> 🕊️
